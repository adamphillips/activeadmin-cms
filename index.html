<h1>Active Admin CMS</h1>

<p>
ActiveAdmin CMS is an easy way to add simple CMS functionality to <a href="http://activeadmin.info">ActiveAdmin</a> for Ruby on Rails applications.
</p>

<h3>What does it do</h3>

<p>ActiveAdmin CMS allows you to define recipes for CMS content using a simple Ruby DSL</p>
<p>For example, a simple recipe might look like:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false;">
module Recipes
  class Default &lt; Cms::Recipe
    
    define do
      section :main_content do
        image :title_image, :hint => 'An image containing the title of the page'
        string :sub_heading, :hint => 'The text that appears in bold under the title'
        text :content, :hint => 'The main copy for the page'
      end

      section :side_bar do
        image :image_1
        image :image_2
      end
    end

  end
end
</pre>

<p>This defines the administration screen in ActiveAdmin for pages using this recipe.</p>

<div class="screenshot_container">
  <p>ActiveAdmin edit screen for the above recipe</p>
  <img src="/images/posts/intro/admin-screen1.png" alt="ActiveAdmin edit screen for the above recipe" title="ActiveAdmin edit screen for the above recipe" />
</div>

<p>A recipe is made up of a number of different pieces of content, which can be one of a number of types including markdown formatted text and images.  You can also define additional custom types if you need them.</p>

<p>To render the html for the entered content is as simple as using</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false">
cms_content('main_content:title_image')
</pre>

<p>in your view</p>

<h3>What doesn't it do?</h3>

<p>ActiveAdmin CMS aims to cater for small but design-intensive websites.  Therefore it leaves developer-centric tasks, such as the defining of routes, to the developer.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a CMS to manage your 1000 page website where you can just apply a one-size-fits-all template to the entire website, then this probably isn't for you.  On the other hand, if you have a 10 page website but each page is specifically crafted with different CMS requirements this could be exactly what you need</p>
